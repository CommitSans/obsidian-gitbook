Amalgamating UX process into the software development life cycle (SDLC) is one of the challenging jobs faced by UX Architects / Designers. the reason why it is challenging because it consists of various methodologies. Considering my 14 years of experience in end user communication, research and design for products, projects and services for various software industries, I am going to put forth the way I adapted User Experience in SDLC models.

 ## SDLC Models

### 1) Waterfall model
Waterfall model is the simplest model of software development paradigm. It says that all the phases of SDLC will function one after another in linear manner. That is, when the first phase is finished then only the second phase will start and so on.

This model assumes that everything is carried out and taken place perfectly as planned in the previous stage and there is no need to think about the past issues that may arise in the next phase. This model does not work smoothly if there are some issues left at the previous step. The sequential nature of model does not allow us go back and undo or redo our actions.

Let’s see how user experience process is injected in waterfall model

There are six phases in waterfall model, the first phase requirement analysis which involves understanding business and functional requirement, here we can inject user research phase which can map end user requirements, User empathy, technical feasibility and design solution approach.

Second phase is system design which starts based on the input from requirement analysis. The output of this step comes in the form of two designs; logical design and physical design. Engineers produce meta-data and data dictionaries, logical diagrams, data-flow diagrams and in some cases pseudo codes. Here we can inject 3 stages of UX design process first one is information architect, second one is interaction design and third one is visual design.

Third phase is implementation (coding) phase also known as programming phase. The implementation of software design starts in terms of writing program code in the suitable programming language and developing error-free executable programs efficiently. here we can inject UI integration phase.

Fourth phase is Testing which is conducted by testing experts at various levels of code such as module testing, program testing, product testing. Here we can inject usability testing which is conducted by usability experts.

### 2) Iterative Model
This model leads the software development process in iterations. It projects the process of development in cyclic manner repeating every step after every cycle of SDLC process.

In this model each iteration also has a well-defined set of objectives and produces a partial working implementation of the final system. And each successive iteration builds on the work of previous iterations to evolve and refine the system until the final product is complete. UX process will continue in each iteration

### 3) Spiral Model
Spiral model is a combination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model i.e. waterfall model with very high emphasis on risk analysis. It allows for incremental releases of the product, or incremental refinement through each iteration around the spiral.

The model starts with determining objectives and constraints of the software at the start of one iteration. Next phase is of prototyping the software. This includes risk analysis. Then one standard SDLC model is used to build the software. In the fourth phase of the plan next iteration is prepared.

### 4) V – model
V- model is considered as an extension of the waterfall model, major drawbacks of waterfall model is we move to the next stage only when the previous one is finished and there was no chance to go back if something is found wrong in later stages. V-Model provides means of testing of software at each stage in reverse manner.

### 5) Agile Model
Agile SDLC model is a combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product.Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds.

Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds. These builds are provided in iterations. Each iteration typically lasts from about one to three weeks. Every iteration involves cross functional teams working simultaneously on various areas like planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing.

Agile model is being widely accepted in the software world recently. Fisrt phase Discovery deal with planning and business requirement gathering . Here we can inject user research , use empathy and technical feasibility evaluation. UX person will interact with product owner for understanding business , users and user stories, accordingly end user communication will begin, this will identify user needs and problems. Normally ux process will start from sprint #0, this will continue in each iteration.

Second phase is system design which starts based on the input from requirement analysis. Here we can inject 3 stages of UX design first one is information architect, second one is interaction design and third one is visual design. UX workshop and brainstorming session will be conducted here, UX team will collaborate with product owners, developers, designers and end users for finalize design solution. this will continue in each iteration.

Third phase is development phase also known as programming phase. The implementation of software design starts in terms of writing program code in the suitable programming language and developing error-free executable programs efficiently. Here we can inject UI integration phase (UX and UI Consultation).

Fourth phase is Testing which is conducted by testing experts at various levels of code such as module testing, program testing, product testing. Here we can inject usability testing which is conducted by usability experts.
